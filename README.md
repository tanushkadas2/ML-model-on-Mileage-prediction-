# Mileage-Prediction-ML-Project
# Objective
The objective of the Mileage Prediction project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts vehicle fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, mpg) based on various features such as engine displacement, horsepower, and weight.

This project aims to explore and understand the relationships between these features and fuel efficiency through data visualization and statistical analysis. By testing and fine-tuning different machine learning algorithms, the project seeks to identify the model with the highest predictive accuracy. Additionally, the project involves handling missing data through imputation techniques to ensure a clean dataset.

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can help manufacturers optimize vehicle design for better fuel efficiency and assist consumers in making informed decisions when purchasing vehicles.

# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning and statistics for predictive modeling.
# Applications:

Predictive Modeling: Used to predict outcomes such as sales, prices, and trends.
Trend Analysis: Identifying trends and relationships in data.
Risk Management: Assessing risk factors and their impact on outcomes.
Economics and Finance: Forecasting economic indicators and financial performance.
